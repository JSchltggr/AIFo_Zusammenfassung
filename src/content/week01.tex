\textbf{Supervised Learning:} System training with features and labels Examples: Visual Recognition, Email Spam Detection, Fraud Detection \\
\textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} System training without labels Example: Social network analysis, Recommendation Systems, Astronomical data, clustering of news articles. \\
\textbf{Reinforced Learning:} A system learn based on negative or positive feedback to do the right things. Example: AI for Arcade Game. \\

\subsection{Turing Test (Imitation Game)}
is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. A Person is in a room in fron to of two screens and has a conversation with a human and a computer and can clearly say which one is the computer.
